# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
# m1 = Message.create(user: "coolCat", content: "Heyyy BigG! Long time no chat!")
# m2 = Message.create(user: "bigG", content: "Who is this? And why are you messaging me while I'm trying to code?")

# m3 = Message.create(user: "coolCat", content: "Oh sNaP D: K3eP iT up D0od. uR g0nNa b3 a l33t hax0r 1 dAy xD")
# m4 = Message.create(user: "bigG", content: "wooooooord")

# m5 = Message.create(user: "coolCat", content: "bRo c0uLD i AsK eWe a Qu3St1on Br0??")

# m6 = Message.create(user: "bigG", content: "Yes, but only if you promise to never type like that again...")
